## Ubuntu Essentials
Most of the apps me and many others use daily, now in a convenient bash script.
```sh
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ClaytonTDM/scripts/main/ubuntu-essentials.sh | bash
```

## Windows Essentials
Same as Ubuntu Essentials, but for Windows 10 (1809+) and Windows 11.
```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ClaytonTDM/scripts/main/windows-essentials.bat -o windows-essentials.bat
./windows-essentials.bat
```
